# LIMS API Documentation and Schemas

This repository contains the official **schemas, sample payloads, and documentation** for the **LIMSâ€“PCR Interoperability API**, developed under the **National AIDS & STI Control Programme (NASCP)**.  

The API supports the **exchange of laboratory sample and result data** between:
- **Sending Facilities / EMRs**  
- **PCR Laboratories (LIMS)**  
- **National Data Repositories (NDR/NMRS)**  

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The API facilitates:
1. **Manifest Submission** â€“ Sending sample manifests (VL & EID) from facilities to PCR labs.  
2. **Result Exchange** â€“ Returning Viral Load (VL) and Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) results from labs.  
3. **Result Requests** â€“ Facilities querying PCR labs for results by `manifestID`.  
4. **Notifications / Feedback** â€“ Handling issues such as mismatched IDs, rejected samples, and missing results.
